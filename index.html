AI Assistance Disclosure
- thoughtfully used Replit Assistant mainly for debugging, but it was also helpful for:
  - getting the headings to display the information boxes after they are clicked
  - the menu button to be on the right side of the screen
  - links to show up from javascript code
Google Disclosure
- I used an icon from Google's free icons

    <p>Because of how technology has progressed today, there are a wide variety of people using the internet, apps, websites, and more. However, as people learn to code websites, they also need to learn how to make their website more accessible. It would not be fair to exclude someone from using the website simply because there were no measures put in place for them to be able to interact with the website too. As a result, here you can learn more about some tools to use to combat this issue.</p>
    <br>
    <p>First, it is important to focus on each group you are coding for. What could be an issue for them? How can this issue be solved? Click on the topics below to learn more.</p>

      <h3 class="boxpara">Key things to incorporate:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add alternate (alt) text for images</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Although screen readers can be very helpful, they cannot literally "read" images. This is something a programmer needs to add to their code so that the screen reader can describe the image. Make sure the alt code is very clear and descriptive of what is shown.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Clear labels</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To make it easier for people to use the website properly, it is important to label everything clearly. For example, if there is a text box, it must have clear instructions for what the text box is there for.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Smooth keyboard use</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Create an efficient order of the website so that pressing tab goes to the next section.</li>
            <li>Create buttons/links for the user to skip to the main content of the page.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Transcriptions</li>
          <ul>
            <li>For the screen reader to describe content like videos or audio clips, it can be helpful to include a transcript of what is said and some descriptions.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="boxpara">There are many different types of color blindness, but the main thing to strive for is color contrast. Here are some key things to incorporate:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrasting colors</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is important to put colors that contrast enough, particularly if it is something important to the website, like a button. Using a contrast checker can help with this.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Be somewhat independent from colors</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Although the colors are important for the design of a website, they do not need to be the only element to use. Adding shapes or other visuals can also help differentiate between certain sections, labels, or headings.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="boxpara">Key things to incorporate:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add captions to audio elements.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The main key is to add captions for audio. Although AI or other technology can automatically generate captions, it can be wrong. It is important to check it or do it yourself.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Create good audio/caption controls</li>
          <ul>
            <li>There needs to be good control buttons for users so that they can press play and know that the video is playing (playing it automatically can cause problems). Also, being able to control when to put the captions is important too.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Well-positioned captions</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The captions provided on the website must appear at the right time to go along with the audio, and they should not block the screen either. Being able to piece together the visual part of the video along with the captions smoothly is important.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>

    <p>There are many other types of disabilities that should be accounted for when making a website, but this was a good introduction on where to start. It would be helpful to do even more research about accessibility in coding. Click the button below to find a good place to start.</p>
